INFO ABOUT REFACTOR

When adding a new file FILENAME.rs:
    - Anything that will need to be accessed from other files 
      (functions, enums, structs, attributes, methods) 
      needs pub in front of it.
    - In lib.rs:
        pub mod FILENAME;
    - Accessing things in FILENAME.rs from other files:
        use crate::FILENAME::{things};
        - ONE EXCEPTION:
          macros are always imported with
            use crate::MACRO_NAME;
          regardless of what file they are in.
